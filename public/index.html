This coming Sunday, we begin our Advent journey once again.  How will this Advent be different from all others?  This year, how will we meaningfully prepare for the coming of the Christ Child into our hearts?</p>                    <p>The Advent season perhaps is not so much about what we 'do' as how we 'are' during this time of quiet anticipation.  If we let it, Advent helps prepare us for the coming of our Savior.  If that is so, then we might naturally ask ourselves, "From what do we need saving?"  The readings during Advent challenge us to wait for the day of the Lord, but they also demand that justice reign.  In the biblical sense, justice refers to right relationship with God and the quality of that relationship is measured by one's behavior toward God and others.  These demands of justice are not mere suggestions - they are commands.  Advent therefore, presents us with specific questions, such as:  "How am I living in 'right relationship' with God?"  If you and I are God's Holy People, if we are in covenant relationship with God, then we must be advocates for  justice wherever injustice is present.  Preparing by contemplation and prayer will help us grow and make us ready to act when the time is right.</p>                    <p>Another theme that is so much a part of this holy season is penitential.  We, as God's people, are to recognize, name and resolve to eradicate whatever evil is a part of our lives.  We often focus on such issues during Lent, but Advent has a penitential quality as well.  Throughout Advent we hear from various prophets who cry out: "Repent and change your lives!"  In our hearts, we know that the prophets' reminder is as relevant today as it was in ancient times.  They heralded the light that would shine forth in the darkness.  Christ is that light.  Throughout Advent we are to embrace the light and become the light of Christ in the world.</p>                  <p>Advent, Christmas and Epiphany form a unity.  We can't engage in one season without reflection upon the other.  Christmas is the ultimate reminder that Jesus Christ - while fully divine - was also fully human.  During this holy time of reflection and anticipation, it is my personal Christmas wish that each member of our Saint Gregory Parish Family know the loving embrace of Christ our Savior.  He came for you!  Receive him into your heart with hospitality and hope ... And may countless blessings be upon you and those you love this Christmas.</p>                  <p>                    Sincerely in Christ,<br><br>                    Rev.
